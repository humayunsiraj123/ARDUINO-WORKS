Introduction
The CAN Receiver project utilizes an Arduino board to receive data over the CAN bus. It demonstrates how to set up the Arduino as a CAN receiver and process incoming CAN messages. This code can be used as a starting point for projects involving CAN communication.

Prerequisites
Before using this code, ensure you have the following:

Arduino IDE installed on your computer (Download Arduino IDE)
CAN bus shield or module connected to your Arduino board
Hardware Setup
To set up the hardware for this project, follow these steps:

Connect the CAN bus shield or module to your Arduino board according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Make sure the CAN bus shield or module is properly powered and connected to the CAN bus you intend to receive data from.
Usage
To use the CAN_RECIVER.ino code file, follow these steps:

Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
Open the CAN_RECIVER.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
In the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board and port under the "Tools" menu.
Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board.
Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the received CAN messages.
The code includes comments to explain the different sections and functionalities. Modify the code as needed to adapt it to your specific requirements.
